/*
 * Unicode Symbol Handling
 * The main goal of the tsm_symbol_* functions is to provide a datatype which
 * can contain the representation of any printable character. This includes all
 * basic Unicode characters but also combined characters.
 * To avoid all the memory management we still represent a character as a single
 * integer value (tsm_symbol_t) but internally we allocate a string which is
 * represented by this value.
 *
 * A tsm_symbol_t is an integer which represents a single character point.
 * For most Unicode characters this is simply the UCS4 representation. In fact,
 * every UCS4 characters is a valid tsm_symbol_t object.
 * However, Unicode standard allows combining marks. Therefore, some characters
 * consists of more than one Unicode character.
 * A global symbol-table provides all those combined characters as single
 * integers. You simply create a valid base character and append your combining
 * marks and the table will return a new valid tsm_symbol_t. It is no longer
 * a valid UCS4 value, though. But no memory management is needed as all
 * tsm_symbol_t objects are simple integers.
 *
 * The symbol table contains two-way
 * references. The Hash Table contains all the symbols with the symbol ucs4
 * string as key and the symbol ID as value.
 * The index array contains the symbol ID as key and a pointer to the ucs4
 * string as value. But the hash table owns the ucs4 string.
 * This allows fast implementations of *_get() and *_append() without long
 * search intervals.
 *
 * When creating a new symbol, we simply return the UCS4 value as new symbol. We
 * do not add it to our symbol table as it is only one character. However, if a
 * character is appended to an existing symbol, we create a new ucs4 string and
 * push the new symbol into the symbol table.

/*
 * UTF8 State Machine
 * This state machine parses UTF8 and converts it into a stream of Unicode
 * characters (UCS4 values). A state-machine is represented by a
 * "struct tsm_utf8_mach" object. It has no global state and all functions are
 * re-entrant if called with different state-machine objects.
 *
 * tsm_utf8_mach_new(): This creates a new state-machine and resets it to its
 * initial state. Returns 0 on success.
 *
 * tsm_uft8_mach_free(): This destroys a state-machine and frees all internally
 * allocated memory.
 *
 * tsm_utf8_mach_reset(): Reset a given state-machine to its initial state. This
 * is the same state the machine is in after it got created.
 *
 * tsm_uft8_mach_feed(): Feed one byte of the UTF8 input stream into the
 * state-machine. This function returns the new state of the state-machine after
 * this character has been parsed. If it is TSM_UTF8_ACCEPT or TSM_UTF8_REJECT,
 * then there is a pending UCS4 character that you should retrieve via
 * tsm_utf8_mach_get(). If it is TSM_UTF8_ACCEPT, then a character was
 * successfully parsed. If it is TSM_UTF8_REJECT, the input was invalid UTF8 and
 * some error recovery was tried or a replacement character was choosen. All
 * other states mean that the machine needs more input to parse the stream.
 *
 * tsm_utf8_mach_get(): Returns the last parsed character. It has no effect on
 * the state machine so you can call it multiple times.
 *
 * Internally, we use TSM_UTF8_START whenever the state-machine is reset. This
 * can be used to ignore the last read input or to simply reset the machine.
 * TSM_UTF8_EXPECT* is used to remember how many bytes are still to be read to
 * get a full UTF8 sequence.
 * If an error occurs during reading, we go to state TSM_UTF8_REJECT and the
 * user will read a replacement character. If further errors occur, we go to
 * state TSM_UTF8_START to avoid printing multiple replacement characters for a
 * single misinterpreted UTF8 sequence. However, under some circumstances it may
 * happen that we stay in TSM_UTF8_REJECT and a next replacement character is
 * returned.
 * It is difficult to decide how to interpret wrong input but this machine seems
 * to be quite good at deciding what to do. Generally, we prefer discarding or
 * replacing input instead of trying to decipher ASCII values from the invalid
 * data. This guarantees that we do not send wrong values to the terminal
 * emulator. Some might argue that an ASCII fallback would be better. However,
 * this means that we might send very weird escape-sequences to the VTE layer.
 * Especially with C1 codes applications can really break many terminal features
 * so we avoid any non-ASCII+non-UTF8 input to prevent this.
